We're the Typelevel family of projects and in 2016, we're going to organize two conferences. This is the call for speakers. If you have any questions at all, please contact info@typelevel.org. This form is administrated by Lars Hupel (lars@typelevel.org) and the data you entered will be shared with the programme committee. We won't publish this information without your consent first.
What is Typelevel anyway? It is a community of projects and individuals organized around:

- Pure, typeful, functional programming in Scala
- Independent free and open source software
- A desire to share ideas and code
- Accessible and idiomatic learning resources
- An inclusive, welcoming and safe environment

## What are we looking for?

For a variety of things! Possible topic ranges include, but are not limited to:

- Experience reports:  "How we migrated our code base to shapeless"
- Typelevel project updates: "What's new in Typelevel project X"
- Your project updates: "What's new in X", where X uses Typelevel heavily
- Big picture: "Where is Scala headed for typed FP?"
- Tutorial-style: "Error-handling with cats", "Idiomatic ScalaCheck"
- Tooling: "We can now use Ensime in Notepad"
- Related work: "How language X does typed FP and what we could learn"
- Non-tech issues: "Diversity in the Scala community", "Governance in Typelevel"

Proposals should be related to the Typelevel family in some way or follow the Typelevel spirit.
